## Description

DBuild a generic distributed system architecture that shows statistics in realtime using Kubernetes and service mesh such as Linkerd and some other Cloud Native technologies. In the last part we use a service mesh for traffic splitting an faulty traffic generation with Linkerd and Chaos Mesh to implement Chaos Engineering. This project will be applied visualize Covid-19 Vaccinated people around the world.

## Objetives

1. Understand concurrency and parallelism theory to develop distributed systems.
2. Experiment and test with cloud native tecnologies that helps to develop modern distributed systems.
3. Design distributed systems strategies to improve high concurrency response.
4. Monitor distributed processing using technologies asociated to observability and telemetry.
5. Implement containers and orchestrators in distributed systems.
6. Measure relialability and performance in high availability system.
7. Implement Chaos Engineering
